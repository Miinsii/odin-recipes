        <p>These loaded waffle fries are topped with all of your favorite bacon cheeseburger fixingsâ€”burger-seasoned beef, Cheddar, bacon, and all the right condiments. This serves 2 as a main dish or 6 for a game day snack. If you cannot find Worcestershire pub burger seasoning, just use Montreal steak seasoning.</p>
